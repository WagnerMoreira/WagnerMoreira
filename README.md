# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Front-end Developer with a passion for creating impactful web experiences.
I like to call myself a product-oriented developer and I'm very passionate about technology, My journey in technology began with programming bots for MMORPGs 
using OpenKore where I would write Lua scripts to give instructions to the bots, I got my mind blown by how much I could achieve with technology and this ignited my passion and steered me towards a career in web development.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning back-end development to become a full-stack dev and front-end architecture to get my front-end skills to the next level.
- I mentor people through http://codingcoach.io/ 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on anything related to Sports, E-sports, Fitness and Health, Wellness, IoT, Investing, Video streaming, rpgs/video games, education, and environment-related projects ðŸŒ³.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Front-end Development or any of the above ^. 

Note: the interesting stuff is in the private repos :)
