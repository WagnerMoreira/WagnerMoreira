# Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior front-end Developer and I try to be as useful and meaningful as possible when building things for the web.

I work at Lighthouse Labs which I very much ❤️ and I mentor people through http://codingcoach.io/ (mainly about front-end development).

- 🌱 I'm currently learning: RoR API Development, Blockchain.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on anything related to sports, rpgs/video games, education, fitness, blockchain and environment related projects 🌳.
- 💬 Ask me about: Mentorship and Front-end Development.
