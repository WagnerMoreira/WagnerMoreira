# Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior front-end Developer and I try to be as useful and meaningful as possible when building things for the web.

I work at www.x-team.com which I very much ❤️ and I mentor people through http://codingcoach.io/ (mainly about front-end development).

- 💪 I’m currently contributing to the development of https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/ working on large-scale React Apps using Styled components, Storybook, AppSync, Redux, Jest/Enzyme, and React Testing Library. Part of the work here involves video live-streaming.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Node.js API Development, Blockchain.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to sports, rpgs/video games, fitness, blockchain and environment related projects 🌳.
- 💬 Ask me about: Mentorship and Front-end Development.
