# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Front-end Web Developer and I try to be as useful and meaningful as possible when building things for the web.

I'm currently learning back-end to become a full-stack (the non-myth version)
I mentor people through http://codingcoach.io/ (mainly about front-end development).

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning: Back-end Development, Front-end Architecture.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on anything related to Sports, E-sports, Fitness and Health, Wellness, IoT, Investing, Video streaming, rpgs/video games, education, and environment related projects ðŸŒ³.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Front-end Development, or any of the above ^.

Note: the interesting stuff is in the private repos :)
